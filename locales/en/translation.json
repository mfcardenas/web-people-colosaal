Above all, we want to tackle the problem of the aging of population giving assistance at home.",

Each practical case will show the daily situation that the patient lives with the chosen symptom, for example: Parkinson patient that is going to eat. This simulation is at everyone's disposal, so they can participate, not only checking the own simulation, but also analyzing the situation of this kind of patients when they do their daily activities. You can comment every simulation and, if you are interested, you can participate in the work meetings where these simulations will be created. Your ideas will always be useful to contribute to the improvement of the simulation and to its application into a specific field of study.",

You can participate in the similation of the patients' behavior and in the analyze of the context of the activity.
